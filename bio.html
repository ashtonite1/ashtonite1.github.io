		<h1>Bio</h1>
		<hr/>
		<p class="textbody">
			My name is Ashton and I am pursuing a Computer Engineering degree at Tufts University. While Iâ€™m not doing problem sets, I like to train on the varsity rowing team, build cars with the Tufts Electric Race Team, and play guitar. 
		</p> 
		<p class="textbody">
			Aside from my studies, the biggest part of my life is my involvement with the rowing team. I fell in love with the sport in high school, where I rowed four years for Wayland-Weston Rowing, one of the few competitive public school rowing teams in the country. My passion for competition and hard work was reinvigorated at Tufts, where I found myself among one of the most dedicated and committed group of athletes I could imagine. The best part of my day is getting on the water at six in the morning and training alongside the some of most devoted students at Tufts.

			My time spent with the Tufts Electric Racing Team is also valuable to me. With very limited time and resources, me and other students have to teach ourselves and each other how to approach real engineering problems with little guidance, and figure out how to solve them under the many constraints and obstacles we are presented with. The fact that just a small group of students, almost entirely on their own, can create a functioning electric race car from scratch is an astounding thing to witness and an amazing experience to be a part of.
