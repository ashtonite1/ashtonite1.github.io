		<hr/>
		<p class="textbody">
			My name is Ashton and I am pursuing a Computer Engineering degree at Tufts University. While Iâ€™m not doing problem sets, I like to train on the varsity rowing team, build cars with the Tufts Electric Race Team, and play guitar.

			Aside from my studies, the biggest part of my life is my involvement with the rowing team. I fell in love with the sport in high school, where I rowed four years for Wayland-Weston Rowing, one of the few competitive public school rowing teams in the country. My passion for competition and hard work was reinvigorated at Tufts, where I found myself among one of the most dedicated and committed group of athletes I could imagine. The best part of my day is getting on the water at six in the morning and training alongside the some of most devoted students at Tufts.
